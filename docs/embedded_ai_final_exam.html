<h1>ECE 4xx: Embedded Artificial Intelligence - Final Exam</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Finals Week</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2 hours</p>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> Conceptual and Design-Heavy</p>
<p><strong>Coverage:</strong> All topics from Week 1 to Week 10 (Modules 1-8 from Course Topics).</p>
<h2>Exam Format</h2>
<p>The final exam will consist of a combination of question types designed to assess your conceptual understanding of embedded AI principles and your ability to apply these concepts in design scenarios. The exam will <em>not</em> involve coding or direct implementation tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Choice / Short Answer Questions:</strong> (Approx. 40% of total grade) These questions will test your understanding of key definitions, concepts, advantages, challenges, and applications of embedded AI, TinyML, model optimization techniques, and hardware/software frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conceptual Design Problems:</strong> (Approx. 30% of total grade) You will be presented with real-world embedded AI scenarios and asked to propose high-level system designs. This may involve selecting appropriate hardware platforms, outlining software architectures, or choosing suitable AI models and optimization strategies for given constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparative Analysis / Critical Thinking Questions:</strong> (Approx. 30% of total grade) These questions will require you to compare and contrast different embedded AI approaches, analyze trade-offs (e.g., between accuracy, power, memory, and computational complexity), and critically evaluate design choices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exam Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Answer all three questions. Each question is weighted equally.</p>
<h3>Question 1: Smart Doorbell Design</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You are tasked with designing a smart doorbell that can recognize familiar faces and notify the homeowner of their arrival. The doorbell must operate on a low-power budget and have a small form factor.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>
<p>a) Propose a high-level system architecture for this smart doorbell. Specify the key hardware components (e.g., microcontroller, camera, power source) and justify your choices based on the given constraints.</p>
<p>b) Describe the software components of your design, including the AI model you would use for face recognition. Explain why your chosen model is suitable for this application and discuss the trade-offs involved.</p>
<p>c) Outline the steps you would take to optimize the AI model for deployment on the resource-constrained doorbell hardware. Discuss at least two optimization techniques you would employ.</p>
<h3>Question 2: TinyML vs. Edge Computing for Smart Agriculture</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A large-scale farm wants to deploy an AI-powered system to monitor crop health and optimize irrigation. The system needs to analyze images of crops to detect signs of disease or pests.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>
<p>a) Compare and contrast two different approaches for implementing this smart agriculture system:
    i) A TinyML approach where small, low-power devices with cameras are deployed throughout the farm to perform on-device image analysis.
    ii) An edge computing approach where images are streamed from simple cameras to a more powerful edge gateway for processing.</p>
<p>b) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in terms of cost, scalability, power consumption, latency, and model complexity.</p>
<p>c) For the TinyML approach, what are the key challenges in deploying and maintaining a large number of intelligent devices in a harsh outdoor environment?</p>
<h3>Question 3: Security of Embedded AI Systems</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> As embedded AI systems become more prevalent in our daily lives (e.g., in smart locks, autonomous vehicles, and medical devices), ensuring their security is of utmost importance.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>
<p>a) Describe three potential security vulnerabilities of an embedded AI system. For each vulnerability, explain how an attacker could exploit it and the potential consequences.</p>
<p>b) Propose a set of security measures to mitigate the vulnerabilities you described in part (a). Your measures should cover both hardware and software aspects of the system.</p>
<p>c) Discuss the concept of adversarial attacks on AI models. How could an attacker craft an adversarial input to fool an embedded AI system (e.g., a smart lock with face recognition)? What are some potential defense mechanisms against such attacks?</p>
